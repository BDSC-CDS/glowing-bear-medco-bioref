## Getting started
*glowing-bear-medco* needs a MedCo deployment to be used. A description of the available deployment profiles, along with a detailed guide on how to use them, is available 
[here](https://ldsec.gitbook.io/medco-documentation/system-administrator-guide/deployment).

### Use the live development server
```bash
cd deployment
./dev-server.sh
```
The default configuration will attempt to use the local `dev-local-3nodes` deployment of MedCo. 
An alternative configuration is provided to use the deployment `medco-demo.epfl.ch` (if it is online). To use it, update `src/app/config/env.json` with the value `medco-demo`.

### Build the Docker image
```bash
cd deployment
docker-compose build glowing-bear-medco
```

### Generate the mapping table
The crypto utility has a point to integer mapping table present in the file `src/app/utilities/crypto/point-to-int-mapping.ts`.
In order to regenerate this file, e.g. so that it contains more points, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd deployment
USER_ID=$(id -u):$(id -g) docker-compose -f docker-compose.gen-mapping-table.yml run gen-mapping-table
```

Note that the maximum value present in this mapping table is the maximum number that the library will be able to decrypt.
